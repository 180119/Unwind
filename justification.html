					<h1> Design Justifications </h1>
					<br>
					<h2> Explanation design elements: </h2>
					<p> Our target audience are students aged 18-25, this is a target group that often access websites via their phone. That is why it is important that our website has a nice layout on both a large screen (laptop), a medium sized screen and especially on a telephone screen (small sized). Students are also known for losing attention quickly and it is important to get their attention within seconds. We do this by applying small text columns and many visual elements in our website.
					<br>
					<br>
					Actions a visitor should be able to do on our website are:
						<li>find information about the brand;</li>
						<li>find information about stress; </li>
						<li>book an activity;</li>
						<li>keep connected to the brand;</li>
						<li>find how to contact us.</li>
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The units of content that are connected to those actions are:
						<li>a paragraph about what we stand for as a brand and what our vision is;</li>
						<li>a paragraph with information about stress; </li>
						<li>a booking page to book an activity;</li>
						<li>information about our service (the relaxing actities);</li>
						<li>links to our social media pages.</li>
						<li> a contact form</li>
					</p>
					
					<!-- end part 1 -->	

					<!-- start part 2 -->	
					<p> We chose the following optional extras:
	  						<li> Product comparison (our service page)</li>
	  						<li> Links (to social media)</li>
	  						<li> Contact (using a contact form)</li>
						
					</p>

						<h2> Navigation workflow:</h2>
						<p> The purpose of our website is to introduce UNWIND to our audience, to convince our audience of the quality our service but most importantly to book a time slot for our activities. That is why we have a separate page on the website where it is possible to reserve a time slot (book now page). Not only can this page be found via the menu at the top of the page, on every page of the website you will find a link to the booking page. This way the booking page can always be reached quickly and easily.

						We have also created a login portal, which is necessary to make a booking. This is at the top right, precisely because on every other website the login portal is also on the right, it is easy to find on our website.

						The great thing about our website is that every time you send something to us (for example, log in, make a booking or fill in the contact form), this leads to a message indicating that this “activity” has been completed/confirmed/send successful.
						</p>
	<!-- end part 5 -->	

	<!-- start part 6 -->	
						<h2> Overall design: </h2>
						<p> We have tried to stay as close to the corporate look and feel of our brand as possible. The website is very clean because of the many white uses and with light yellow and light blue details that are reflected in our logo (see logo on top left of the pages). The fonts we used are also reflected in our UNWIND brandbook (made for brand development).
						</p>
	<!-- end part 6 -->	

	<!-- start part 7 -->
						<h3> Colors codes:</h3>
						
								<li>H1 = #8bc6f4</li>
								<li>Text color = #384463</li>
								<li>Buttons and other accents = #384463 </li>
								<li>Hover color buttons and footer = #fff0b3 </li>

	<!-- end part 8 -->	

	<!-- start part 9 -->	
						<h3> Menu: </h3>
						<p> On the left side of our menu is the UNWIND logo. So that it is always visible on every page and immediately sprints into the eye of the audience (people always look / read from left to right, so the focus is always on the left first). The order of the menu is made in such a way that it has a logical flow of information. When the website is accessed from a phone, the menu changes from a horizontal bar to a collapsed menu. This is to keep space and overview on the small screen.
						</p>
	<!-- end part 9 -->	

	<!-- start part 10 -->	
						<h3> Landing page:</h3>
						<p> When you click on our website, you arrive on the landing page. Immediately attention is drawn to a carousel with large high quality images. These immediately give an impression of the activities we offer without our audience having to read anything. Below the large images are small pieces of text that provide more information about the website. There is also a button that links to the "book now" page, making it easy for the audience (without further reading or searching) to make a reservation.
						</p>
	<!-- end part 10 -->	

	<!-- start part 11 -->
						<h3>About page:</h3>
						<p> The about page consists of a small piece of text, which explains by who and why UNWIND was founded. With pictures of us there. We do this to give an extra personal touch to the website which is highly appreciated by our audience (indicated in test 2). It is still a short piece of text because we want to say as much as possible with the shortest possible text and we want to keep the attention of the audience.
						</p>	
	<!-- end part 11 -->	

	<!-- start part 12 -->	
						<h3> Our service page:</h3>
						<p> On the our service page, we provide information about every activity that UNWIND offers. We do this by adding small pieces of text and a photo. To give an impression without the audience having to read. A book now button is placed under each piece. We did this because after reading about the activity, and attention has been drawn, it makes it easy for the audience to book the activity directly.
						</p>
	<!-- end part 12 -->	

	<!-- start part 13 -->	
						<h3> Contact page: </h3>
						<p> We deliberately kept the contact form simple. The form offers an easy way for the audience to contact us. The address (Breda University) is also indicated on this page.
						</p>
	<!-- end part 13 -->	

	<!-- start part 14 -->
						<h3>Justification: </h3>
						<p>  The justification can be found in the footer. Because the justification is only relevant for grading lecturers and not for our audience.
						</p>	
	<!-- end part 14 -->	

	<!-- start part 15 -->	
						<h3>Footer: </h3>
						<p> We also use icons, for example for instagram and facebook. These icons are very recognizable for the students and will attract attention rather than placing the written word "Link to Instagram" on the website. These social media accounts were part of the marketing promotional campaign of our brand, which in this way is also linked to the campaign (the socials will have a link of our website in their description). We also link this social media account to provide our audience with an extra visual impressions of our brand. Since our target audience spend lots of time on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. 
						</p>
	<!-- end part 15 -->	

	<!-- start part 16 -->	
						<h2> User Testing:</h2>
						<p> Regarding the user testings, we had two moments to test our website. The first test moment was during the web development class about prototyping. For the second test, we asked 20 participant to review our prototypes. We showed our paper drafts to different people and analyzed the way they use the website and noted feedback. After these feedback moments we made our final versions prototypes via Wireframe.cc.
						</p>
	<!-- end part 16 -->	

	<!-- start part 17 -->
						<h3> Test 1: </h3>
						<p> During the web development class, we draw our first prototype of the UNWIND website. These prototypes were basic set ups of each page. We asked two other groups (each group consists of 4 students) to look at our paper prototypes. With each new prototype we gave a short description of what the page is, but not what the purpose of the page is, to see if that was clear from the website itself. We let Adinda Berends test our initial framework, she gave us tips on the structure of it all. For instance, adding a button for booking on the home page and adding a confirmation page. She also gave feedback that the pages should have a ‘simple’ structure, so not too many additions or components. After we received the feedback, we made a more defined and detailed versions, again on paper. This version was drafted up more meticulously and were shown to all of our 20 participants in test 2. </p>	
	<!-- end part 17 -->	

	<!-- start part 18 -->	
						<h3>Test 2: </h3>
						<p> The set up for the second test was slightly different from the first. The prototypes were more detailed (and feedback from test 1 was added). We hardly had to explain this when showing every prototype of every page. In an interview, we presented the prototype to each participant and asked the following questions;</p>

								<li>How would you describe UNWIND?</li>
								<li>What does UNWIND offer? </li>
								<li>What is the purpose of each page of the website (purpose of landing page, about page, our service page, contact page and book page).</li>
								<li>What do you think of the order of information on the website? </li>
								<li>What information do you miss? </li>
							
						<p> Scenario 1:
						Try to log in with your student codes.</p>

						<p> Scenario 2:
						Try book the ‘cuddling with puppies activity for June 1st at 13:00. </p>

						<p> We documented these answers in audio recordings (of course asked permission to use these recordings), so we can easily review each feedback. Almost all of our participants told us that we had an already solid basis, referring to the layout and structure of the website. These prototypes only showed headers to indicate what content is on each page, so this does not include the extensive text that can now be seen on our website. Therefore, the 20 participants who reviewed our prototype made suggestion based on structure, layout and purpose. </p>

						<p> To tests the usability of a our website, we want to check the “5 Es of usability”. Is our website Effective, Efficient, Engaging, Error tolerant, Easy. </p>

						<p> All participants indicated that they understood UNWIND as a site for students with stress. And that UNWIND offers activities to reduce stress. Their impression of the brand matched what we have in mind; namely calm and clear, this suited the reduction of stress and participants indicated that they found this satisfying to look at (Engaging). The participants understood the purpose of the website, as to inform but especially to reserve an activity. They understood the purpose for each page. We also looked at how they follow the navigation via the website (how to get to the login and booking system) and we saw that could easily move through the website (Effective, Efficient and Easy). The participants also indicated that they liked that when they want to book but have forgotten to log in, the website indicates this by offering a possibility to log in on the bookings page itself (Error tolerant).</p>

						<p>During the execution of the scenarios by our participants, we paid attention to; the duration of each scenario, the ease with which the scenario should be able to be executed and hesitations of participants. In particular, scenario 1 was very easy for the participants. Participants were able to quickly find the login portal and were logged in within seconds. The participants took a little longer to execute scenario 2, this is also logical because there are also more to fill in to booking an activity. We saw that participants could easily reach the book page and also find the book system easy to use.

						<h3> Improvements based on User testing: </h3>
						<p> The participants of Test 2 gave us the following suggestions: </p>
							
								<li> Our website should have some ‘quick’ info on our service on our homepage, that people instantly know what our 		brand/website is about. </li>
								<li> In addition, the participants suggested to create a clear navigation flow to the booking system, to make it 		   easy for the audience to book a time-slot. </li>
								<li> The participants indicated that it was clear that the purpose of the website is to book an activity. They 		   indicated that after reading information it is easy for them to click directly to the "book now" page via the 		button at the end of the text, without searching in the menu. Therefore, we added a ‘book now’ button on the 		home page and our service page, this button will link to the booking page. </li>
								<li> Some of the participants indicated a preference for a visual site that not only explains the activities in 		   text but also shows the activities in photos. We have used this tip and applied it to the landing page; by 		   displaying large images of our activities. </li>
								<li> A few of the participant suggested to not only explain the brand UNWIND on the about page, but also to include 		 photos and information about ourselves. This gives our website a more personal touch and will appeal to the 		   audience to see that we our young students too. </li>

							<p> All the research we gained during these interviews, we used to create our final prototypes. We designed these prototypes with Wireframe.cc, to create a clear example we could use during program process of our actual website. </p>
